        <h2>Working smarter</h2>
        </div>
        <p>I'm a person who works very hard, but besides working very hard I also like to be efficient as possible
        everything I do, ensures that it gets the job done in a much quicker and most efficient manner that I can think of
      at the time. I also make sure that whatever task assigned to me is done, and completed on time and it is a polished
    and acceptable product suitable for whatever purpose that is required of it. I think it is very important to make sure that
  my projects are valued and does it's job well because it is a reflection of me as a Programmer and an employee.</p>

          <h2>Cooperation</h2>
          </div>
          <p>I would like to think that I am very friendly, and easy to get a long with at least I try to be. When I work personal differences, and conflicts are set aside in favor
          of finishing the work. Work comes first before everything, personal feelings to me should be left at the door as long as I get paid on time and my employers use
        professionalism in the work place, then there will be no problems. In case I do have a serious conflict, I will try to resolve it as quietly as possibler and without
      notice.</p>

            <h2>Improvement</h2>
            </div>
            <p>I'm constantly looking for ways to improve myself as a Programmer, and as a person so I always look for ways to get better at what I am doing both in life and in work
            so I am very open to critcisim, and comments regarding my work to try and improve myself as a programmer. I try not to take any pride in my work, or to take anything
          personally. I think it's important to constantly strive to improve in the Tech industry, as it is a rapidly growing and advancing industry and if you don't improve you'll fall behind
        and become obsolete in comaprison to your competitor.</p>
