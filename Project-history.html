          This is my past projects that I've developed hopefully it can show you how far I've come as a developer,
          and my overall talent as a developer. Of course I have worked on many projects, these are the ones that I like enough
          to show off. One of my proudest achievments of course was this website, although it doesn't look like much I'd like to
          show it off because it was one of the first real projects that I've done on a large scale that is decent well in my opinion it's decent.
          I'll add more works to my website as the year progress so please keep an eye out for any updates to this page.</p>
